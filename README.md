# ToDoList in React 

A simple Todo list in react, where you can add items and delete. You can also mark them done.
I have used `useEffect` hook to persist the data in localstorage. So everytime time new item is added or deleted, after refreshing the page, the data persists.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
